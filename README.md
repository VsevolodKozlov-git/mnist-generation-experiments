# MNIST generations experiments
In this repository I try to apply ml algorithms, that I learned 
from Andrew NG course, to generationg digits similar to 
digits from MNIST dataset

I don't know any generative algorithms. So, I try to be creative with 
clustering, classification and dimension reduction algosðŸ˜ƒ
